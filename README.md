# Geocoding and Analyzing San Francisco Building Permit Data

## OpenStreetMap + R + Tableau = Hassle Free Geocoding, All the power of R + Tableau BI Tools

In this ninety-minute project-based course, you will explore and analyze more than seven years of the City of San Francisco's building permit data and use OpenStreetMap to find the geo coordinates of buildings. After creating a new clean dataset that includes geo coordinates, you will use Tableau to visualize and analyze the dataset. 

By the end of this project, you will apply basic analytics techniques to open source data, utilize OpenStreetMap API to find geo coordinates of building addresses, and finally, you will put it all together in Tableau to generate additional insights.
